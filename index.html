			<h2>My Resume</h2>
			<p> My Personal Portfolio objective is to provide the reviewer with as much relevant information about me as possible.
				It presents evidence of my relevant skills and abilities, educational accomplishments and activities, work experience and community involvement! 
				It’s my pleasure to confess my strengths and
weakness. I am Priyanka Kumari.
As coin has two sides , I too have two sides .
Everyday begins with brightness ,so let me start
with brighter side . I am focused, flexible,
passionate and persistent to learn new things and
create an opportunity to implement those. I have
good interpersonal and introspection skills. My
strongest asset is my work ethic and my willingness
to step in when needed . Optimistic, adaptable and
decisive elucidate me but family, hunger for
knowledge, hard and smart work completes me.
Of course, I am gregarious and scripturient. I have a
magic effect that makes people like me. I have
preferred to work in teams and find that
collaborative nature is one of my strongest
attributes. I meet deadlines under stringent time
constraints. My biggest strength is my ability to
work well under pressure. I stay calm and can think
clearly even though I am faced with lot of pressure

or tight deadlines. Since I can find compromises well
I have been able to mediate many difficult
situations. 4C’s define me, those are creative,
curious, charming and caring. Empathetic,
determined, self controlled and affable are other
buzzwords which explicate me. I am good at finding
the simplest and most efficient solution. Oh yes! I
am emotionally intelligent . I follow my heart but
take my brain with me .
Now the darker side,
I am the biggest critic of my own work and tend to
be overly critical of myself. This often leave me
feeling burned out. I am incredibly reluctant and shy
which make me wary of sharing my ideas in team
meetings. I have started trying to get comfortable
discussing my thoughts . It’s still a work in progress,
but it’s something that I have improved dramatically
over the past year. Fear is what stops me, courage is
that keeps me going.
That’s all I have analysed and actively working on it<p>
